# crimemap
R code for a Shiny web application that displays the locations and categories of crimes occurring in San Francisco for a specific date and time.

Crime data for 2003-present is obtained from [SF OpenData](https://data.sfgov.org/).

Web app found [here](https://kcschuster.shinyapps.io/crimemap/).
